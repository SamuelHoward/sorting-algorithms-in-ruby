# sorting-algorithms-in-ruby
A repository for writing sorting algorithms in ruby.

I am working on this to practice ruby as well as brush up on sorting algorithms.

Currently the algorithms included are:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Pancake Sort
- Gnome Sort
